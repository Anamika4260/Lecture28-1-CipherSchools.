The power of a linked list comes from the ability to break the chain and rejoin it. E.g. if you wanted to put an element 4 between 1 and 2, the steps would be:

Create a new struct node and allocate memory to it.
Add its data value as 4
Point its next pointer to the struct node containing 2 as the data value
Change the next pointer of "1" to the node we just created.
Doing something similar in an array would have required shifting the positions of all the subsequent elements.
struct node
{
  int data;
  struct node *next;
};
